I design, build, and run AWS-first platforms that ship reliably at scale. My core strengths are Amazon EKS, CI/CD, and automation. I bring a product mindset to DevOps so teams can deliver faster and safer, with clear guardrails and great developer experience. I also cover adjacent SRE and platform engineering practices.

## What I focus on

- **AWS architecture**: VPC design, IAM and security baselines, networking, multi-account setup, cost-aware patterns.
- **Kubernetes on EKS**: cluster and add-on architecture, ingress and service networking, autoscaling, upgrades, multi-region readiness, observability.
- **CI/CD and GitOps**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Argo CD, release strategies, environment promotion, policy and security scans in the pipeline.
- **Automation**: Terraform, Ansible, Python, Bash. Reusable modules, DRY workflows, self-service templates for teams.
- **Observability and reliability**: Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, alerting, SLOs, incident response practices.
- **Platform engineering**: golden paths, paved roads, internal developer tooling that reduces lead time and increases consistency.

## Selected work

- Built and maintained Helm charts and deployed to Kubernetes across internal and internet-facing production systems.
- Planned and executed migrations to AWS and EKS from on-prem and EC2, with phased cutovers and rollback plans.
- Implemented self-service CI/CD with automated builds, tests, and progressive delivery to multiple environments.
- Optimized clusters and workloads for performance and cost through rightsizing, autoscaling, and request/limit hygiene.

## How I work

- **Product mindset**: outcomes over output, tight feedback loops, measurable improvements in delivery and reliability.
- **Security by default**: least privilege IAM, secrets management, image scanning, policy enforcement.
- **DRY and GitOps**: single source of truth, reproducible environments, automation from commit to production.
