I’m your go-to guy to turn ideas into scaleable products. **DevOps? SRE? Platform? MLOps?** I've spent a good chunk of my career making sure both development and production run smoothly, securely, and automated.

My mother used to read me bedtime stories from _Linux in a Nutshell_ and my first word was `sudo`. I’m all about building and maintaining super robust, scalable, and efficient tech infrastructures. It’s kind of like being a digital architect but with less concrete and more code. Here’s where I shine:

- ☁️ **Cloud Infrastructure**: Especially AWS, but all cloud providers just want the same thing.
- 🐳 **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker and Kubernetes are buddies.
- 🔄 **CI/CD Pipelines**: I make Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and ArgoCD do the heavy lifting.
- 🛠️ **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation are my tools of choice.
- 👀 **Monitoring & Observability**: Keeping an eye on things with Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack.
- 📜 **Scripting & Automation**: Bash and Python are my magic wands.
- 💾 **Database Management**: I can handle SQL, NoSQL, and even the complex Data Warehousing.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Operations**: Making sure AI models play nice in the real world.

## Cool Stuff I’ve Done 🚀

**Design HELM charts and deploy them to Kubernetes** - Countless apps, let them be both internal or highly-available multi-region production ones.

**Migrations** - From self-hosted to cloud, from EC2 to EKS. Name it and I plan & implement it.

**Automated CI/CD Pipelines** - Self-service for developers, self-healing for deployments.

**Kubernetes Cluster Optimization** - I fine-tune infrastructure to match project needs and find where the money leaks with cost tracking.
